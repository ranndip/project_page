### Abstract
An implementation of a rapid artificial neural network (RANN) style potential in the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package is presented here which utilizes angular screening to reduce computational complexity without reducing accuracy. For the smallest neural network architectures, this formalism rivals the modified embedded atom method (MEAM) for speed and accuracy, while the networks approximately one third as fast as MEAM were capable of reproducing the training database with chemical accuracy. The numerical accuracy of the LAMMPS implementation is assessed by verifying conservation of energy and agreement between calculated forces and pressures and the observed derivatives of the energy as well as by assessing the stability of the potential in dynamic simulation. The potential style is tested using a force field for magnesium and the computational efficiency for a variety of architectures is compared to a traditional potential models as well as alternative ANN formalisms. The predictive accuracy is found to rival that of slower methods. While machine learning approaches have been successfully used to represent interatomic potentials, their speed has typically lagged behind conventional formalisms. This is often due to the complexity of the structural fingerprints used to describe the local atomic environment and the large cutoff radii and neighbor lists used in the calculation of these fingerprints. Even recent machine learned methods are at least 10 times slower than traditional formalisms.

### Artificial Neural Network Architecture
The energy of a particular atom <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i" title="i" />, determined by its environment, is the last of N layers of the neural network. The values for any particular layer, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?{\bf{A}}^n" title="{\bf{A}}^n" />,after the first is determined by the previous layer and the weight and bias matrices <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbf{W}^n" title="\mathbf{W}^n" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mathbf{B}^n" title="\mathbf{B}^n" />:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Z^n_{l_n}=\sum_{l_{n-1}}{W^n_{l_nl_{n-1}}A^{n-1}_{l_{n-1}}&plus;B^n_{l_n}}" title="Z^n_{l_n}=\sum_{l_{n-1}}{W^n_{l_nl_{n-1}}A^{n-1}_{l_{n-1}}+B^n_{l_n}}" />

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A^n_{l_n}=g^n(Z^n_{l_n})" title="A^n_{l_n}=g^n(Z^n_{l_n})" />

Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?l_n" title="l_n" /> is the number of neurons in layer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n" title="n" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?g^n(x)" title="g^n(x)" /> is a nonlinear activation function. The input layer, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbf{A}^0" title="\mathbf{A}^0" /> is given by the structural fingerprint of the local atomic environment. The ouput layer, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbf{Z}^N" title="\mathbf{Z}^N" />, will always contain a single node, representing the energy, and so <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbf{W}^N" title="\mathbf{W}^N" /> will always be a row vector and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbf{B}^N" title="\mathbf{B}^N" /> always a single number.

For the RANN style, we use the fingerprint style is motivated by the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) formalism with the addition of angular screening. In this style, two different kind of input fingerprints are considered. First, simple pair interactions are considered and summed over all the neighbors of a given atom. For a given atom labeled <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i" title="i" />, we define a set of pair potentials interactions with the form:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F_n=\sum_{j\neq&space;i}{(\frac{r_{ij}}{r_e})^ne^{-\alpha_n\frac{r_{ij}}{r_e}}f_c(\frac{r_c-r_{ij}}{\Delta&space;r})S_{ij}}" title="F_n=\sum_{j\neq i}{(\frac{r_{ij}}{r_e})^ne^{-\alpha_n\frac{r_{ij}}{r_e}}f_c(\frac{r_c-r_{ij}}{\Delta r})S_{ij}}" />

Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?j" title="j" /> labels all the neighbors atoms of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i" title="i" /> within a cutoff radius <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r_c" title="r_c" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n" title="n" /> is an integer, different for each member of the pairwise contributions to the fingerprint, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r_e" title="r_e" /> is the equilibrium nearest neighbor distance, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?S_{ij}" title="S_{ij}" /> is an angular screening term, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\alpha_n" title="\alpha_n" /> are metaparameters, which can be tuned to better optimize the potential. 
The second kind of fingerprint function considers three body terms, with a form similar to the partial electron densities used in MEAM:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?G_{m,k}=\sum_{j,k}{\cos^m{\theta_{jik}}e^{-\beta_k\frac{r_{ij}&plus;r_{ik}}{r_e}}f_c(\frac{r_c-r_{ij}}{\Delta&space;r})f_c(\frac{r_c-r_{ik}}{\Delta&space;r})S_{ij}S_{ik}}" title="G_{m,k}=\sum_{j,k}{\cos^m{\theta_{jik}}e^{-\beta_k\frac{r_{ij}+r_{ik}}{r_e}}f_c(\frac{r_c-r_{ij}}{\Delta r})f_c(\frac{r_c-r_{ik}}{\Delta r})S_{ij}S_{ik}}" />

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\theta_{jik}" title="\theta_{jik}" /> is the angle between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r_{ij}" title="r_{ij}" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r_{ik}" title="r_{ik}" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?m" title="m" /> is a non-negative interger and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta_k" title="\beta_k" /> is a set of metaparameters which determine the length scale of the different terms.
